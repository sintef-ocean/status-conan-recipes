[Conan.io](https://conan.io) recipe for [{1}]({2}).

The package is usually consumed using the `conan install` command or a *conanfile.txt*.

## How to use this package

1. Add remote to conan's package [remotes](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/misc/remote.html?highlight=remotes):

   ```bash
   $ conan remote add sintef https://conan.sintef.io/public
   ```

2. Using *conanfile.txt* in your project with *cmake*

   Add a [*conanfile.txt*](http://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile_txt.html) to your project. This file describes dependencies and your configuration of choice, e.g.:

   ```
   [requires]
   {1}/[>={3}]@sintef/stable

   [options]
   {4}

   [imports]
   licenses, * -> ./licenses @ folder=True

   [generators]
   cmake_paths
   cmake_find_package
   ```

   Insert into your *CMakeLists.txt* something like the following lines:
   ```cmake
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.13)
   project(TheProject CXX)

   include(${{CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}}/conan_paths.cmake)
   find_package({1} MODULE REQUIRED)

   add_executable(the_executor code.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(the_executor {1}::{1})
   ```
   Then, do
   ```bash
   $ mkdir build && cd build
   $ conan install .. -s build_type=<build_type>
   ```
   where `<build_type>` is e.g. `Debug` or `Release`.
   You can now continue with the usual dance with cmake commands for configuration and compilation. For details on how to use conan, please consult [Conan.io docs](http://docs.conan.io/en/latest/)
